# IDEALSCAN — Project Notes for Claude

## OCR Pipeline (server.js — `preprocessForOcr` / `runOcr`)

All photo-based OCR (picking list and product label) goes through two stages:

### Stage 1 — Image preprocessing (`preprocessForOcr`, requires `sharp`)
1. **Greyscale** — removes colour noise that confuses the LSTM model
2. **Normalize** — auto-stretches histogram for better contrast on faded/dim prints
3. **Sharpen** (`sigma 1.5, m1 2.0, m2 0.5`) — crisp text edges reduce letter-doubling artefacts (e.g. DMG→DMMG)
4. Output as **lossless PNG** — avoids JPEG compression artefacts around text

If `sharp` is unavailable the original buffer is passed through unchanged (graceful degradation).

### Stage 2 — Tesseract with LSTM engine (`runOcr`)
- **OEM 1** (LSTM neural-net only) — more accurate than legacy engine
- **PSM 3** (auto page segmentation) for picking lists — lets Tesseract detect the mixed header+table layout
- **PSM 6** (single uniform block) for product labels — compact, few-line documents
- **`preserve_interword_spaces: 1`** — keeps column spacing so the parser can split tokens correctly
- Product label scan also sets a **character whitelist** to block OCR from inventing symbols

Do NOT revert to bare `Tesseract.recognize()` — always call `runOcr()`.

## OCR Parsing Rules (lib/ocr-parse.js)

### Location codes must NEVER become SKUs
Warehouse bin/location codes like `AB-005001-A`, `AB-006-001-B`, `BC-003-035`, `AC-007-003-B`, `DMG-2`, `BIN-1`
look like product codes but are shelf positions. The pattern is:
- **1–4 letter prefix** (up to 4 because OCR can double a letter: `DMG` → `DMMG`)
- 1–3 hyphen-separated digit groups (**1–6 digits each** — note: 1 digit minimum, e.g. `DMG-2`)
- optional hyphen + 1–2 letter suffix

`LOCATION_CODE_PAT = /^[A-Z]{1,4}(-\d{1,6}){1,3}(-[A-Z]{1,2})?$/i`

This is checked and skipped **before** any token is accepted as a SKU. Do not narrow this pattern.

### MIN_SKU_LEN for Picking List mode
`MIN_SKU_LEN = isPickingList ? 4 : 3`

4 in Picking List mode blocks 3-char noise (e.g. `333`) while allowing real 4-digit WMS product codes like `5603`, `8009`, `8101`, `8133`. Do NOT raise this back to 6 — that blocks legitimate short SKUs.

### OCR digit/letter confusion in order numbers (`fixOcrConfusions`)
Only triggered when extracted code is **7+ all-digit characters**.

**Leading fix** (`OCR_LEAD_MAP`): `5→S`, `8→B`, `6→G`
- `0` and `1` are NOT in the leading map — leading zeros are genuine in many codes.
- Example: `500037495` → `S00037495`

**Trailing fix** (`OCR_TRAIL_MAP`): `2→Z` only
- Z is routinely misread as 2 by OCR engines.
- Applied only when leading fix does not fire (they never both apply).
- Example: `010720262` → `01072026Z`

**Do NOT merge these into one map or apply both at once.** Leading takes priority; trailing only fires if leading did not match.

### Scope — apply to ALL extracted document codes
`fixOcrConfusions` must be called on **every** extracted alphanumeric code field:
- order number (both inline and two-line extraction paths)
- reference, issue no, pick ticket
- batch/lot number

The 7+ all-digit guard means short numeric codes (SKUs like `5603`, batches like `533601`) are never touched. **Do not apply to SKU tokens** — SKUs must match WMS records exactly.

## OCR Qty Parsing (lib/ocr-parse.js)

### Qty must be found BEFORE a UOM keyword, not as rightmost integer
`UOM_RE = /^(?:EACH|EA|PCS|PIECES|BOX|CTN|CARTON|CARTO|CARTOS|UOM)$/i`

Numeric batch numbers like `533601` and `517008` are all-digits and would be mistaken for qty
if we used rightmost-integer logic. Always prefer the integer before a UOM keyword; fall back to
rightmost integer only when no UOM is present.

### Batch/expiry extraction
After qty+UOM, columns follow: `/`, `CARTO`, `Total LHU (= repeated qty)`, `BatchNo`, `ExpiryDate`.
- Skip: `/`, UOM-like tokens, the repeated qty value
- Take: next alphanumeric token (2+ chars) → batch number (can be pure-digit like `533601` or letters like `RT`)
- Take: date-like token matching `\d{1,2}[/-]\w+[/-]\d{2,4}` → expiry date
