# IDEALSCAN — Project Notes for Claude

## OCR Parsing Rules (lib/ocr-parse.js)

### Location codes must NEVER become SKUs
Warehouse bin/location codes like `AB-005001-A`, `AB-006-001-B`, `BC-003-035`, `AC-007-003-B`, `DMG-2`, `BIN-1`
look like product codes but are shelf positions. The pattern is:
- 1–3 letter prefix
- 1–3 hyphen-separated digit groups (**1–6 digits each** — note: 1 digit minimum, e.g. `DMG-2`)
- optional hyphen + 1–2 letter suffix

`LOCATION_CODE_PAT = /^[A-Z]{1,3}(-\d{1,6}){1,3}(-[A-Z]{1,2})?$/i`

This is checked and skipped **before** any token is accepted as a SKU. Do not narrow this pattern.

### MIN_SKU_LEN for Picking List mode
`MIN_SKU_LEN = isPickingList ? 4 : 3`

4 in Picking List mode blocks 3-char noise (e.g. `333`) while allowing real 4-digit WMS product codes like `5603`, `8009`, `8101`, `8133`. Do NOT raise this back to 6 — that blocks legitimate short SKUs.

### OCR digit/letter confusion in order numbers (`fixOcrConfusions`)
Only triggered when extracted code is **7+ all-digit characters**.

**Leading fix** (`OCR_LEAD_MAP`): `5→S`, `8→B`, `6→G`
- `0` and `1` are NOT in the leading map — leading zeros are genuine in many codes.
- Example: `500037495` → `S00037495`

**Trailing fix** (`OCR_TRAIL_MAP`): `2→Z` only
- Z is routinely misread as 2 by OCR engines.
- Applied only when leading fix does not fire (they never both apply).
- Example: `010720262` → `01072026Z`

**Do NOT merge these into one map or apply both at once.** Leading takes priority; trailing only fires if leading did not match.

### Scope — apply to ALL extracted document codes
`fixOcrConfusions` must be called on **every** extracted alphanumeric code field:
- order number (both inline and two-line extraction paths)
- reference, issue no, pick ticket
- batch/lot number

The 7+ all-digit guard means short numeric codes (SKUs like `5603`, batches like `533601`) are never touched. **Do not apply to SKU tokens** — SKUs must match WMS records exactly.
